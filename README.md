  ### Description:
  The project is an assignment of a coding bootcamp program, with the purpose for students learn how to use React. The website is a portfolio that serves as a place not only to share projects while applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share work with other developers and collaborate on projects.



  ### Installation:
  - Clone the initial code git repository.
  - Navigate on the terminal to the directory react-portfolio where the code was cloned to.
  - Type "npm i" and "npm start".

  ### Usage:

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
  - I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
  - WHEN I load the portfolio THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
  - WHEN I view the header THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
  - WHEN I view the navigation titles THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
  - WHEN I click on a navigation title THEN the browser URL changes and I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation and that title is highlighted
  - WHEN I load the portfolio the first time THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
  - WHEN I am presented with the About Me section THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
  - WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
  - WHEN I am presented with the Contact section THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
  - WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
  - WHEN I enter text into the email address field THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
  - WHEN I am presented with the Resume section THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
  - WHEN I view the footer THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

  ### Contributing
  I have received advice from the UC Berkeley Extension tutors Henry Weigand on pseudocoding and Matthew Calimbas on debugging and testing my code. I also reached out to the [Mozilla Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) webpage and [NPM Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/) for documentation.
